Quant Trading Terminal is a web application that allows users to develop, test, and execute quantitative trading strategies. This project was developed as a B.Tech final year project.

## Features

The Quant Trading Terminal provides the following features:

- Backtesting: Users can test their trading strategies using historical market data to see how their strategies would have performed in the past.
- Real-time trading: Users can execute their trading strategies in real-time using real market data.
- Strategy development: Users can develop and refine their trading strategies using the platform's built-in tools.
- Customizable trading algorithms: The platform allows users to create their own trading algorithms using Python code.

## Trading Strategies

The Quant Trading Terminal includes a variety of pre-built trading strategies that users can utilize or customize. These strategies include:

- Moving Average Crossover: A popular strategy that involves buying when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, and selling when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.
- Bollinger Bands: A strategy that uses a volatility-based indicator to identify when a security is overbought or oversold.
- Relative Strength Index (RSI): A momentum-based strategy that uses a technical indicator to identify when a security is overbought or oversold.
